# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To install and operate Wellenplan you will need at least a basic understanding
of the following:

* A container orchestrator like Kubernetes to run the Wellenplan container
* A way to securely expose Wellenplan to your users
* PostgreSQL Database System
* Persistent file storage for uploaded files

If you are not familiar with the above, it is recommended that you consult
with the IT staff of your station before proceeding.

## Installation

Since Wellenplan is still in the early stages of development, the best way to
give Wellenplan a try is to set up a development environment as described
in the [Wellenplan wiki](https://github.com/wellenplan/wellenplan/wiki/Development).

::: danger Wellenplan is not production ready
Following the wiki will not result in a production ready installation. We expect the
installation process to be finalised once Wellenplan is closer to being ready for use.
